# DLP4500LightCrafter

This repository provides python code Python USB controller for the TI DLP LightCrafter 4500. The main purpose is to use high speed pattern sequence mode, projecting patterns from pre-loaded patterns in firmware. Please relate to documents for pre-loading patterns in firmware.

The core program is borrowed from SivyerLab/pyCrafter4500 developed by [SivyerLab](https://github.com/SivyerLab/pyCrafter4500). I have modified the original python code, adding functions needed for pattern sequence mode. I acknowledge and respect his pioneering work.
